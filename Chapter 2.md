# Chapter 2
## Intro
- __Data transmission__ occurs btw __transmitter__ and __receiver__ over some __transmission medium__
- To be transmitted, data must be transformed to electromagnetic signals.
  - Can propagate along the transmission medium

- Transmission Medium
  - Guided medium: the signals are guided along a physical path
    - e.g., twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fiber
  - Unguided medium: wireless
    - e.g., air, water, vacuum

## Terminology (2)
- Direct link
  - Refer to the transmission path between the transmitter and receiver in which signals propagate directly with no intermediate devices, other than __amplifiers__ or __repeaters__ used to increase signal strength
  - Apply to both guided and unguided media

- A transmission medium is __point-to-point__ if:
  - Direct link
  - Only 2 devices share the medium

- A transmission medium is __multipoint__ if:
  - More than 2 devices share the same medium
