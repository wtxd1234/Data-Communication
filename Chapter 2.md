# Chapter 2
## Intro
- __Data transmission__ occurs btw __transmitter__ and __receiver__ over some __transmission medium__
- To be transmitted, data must be transformed to electromagnetic signals.
  - Can propagate along the transmission medium

- Transmission Medium
  - Guided medium: the signals are guided along a physical path
    - e.g., twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fiber
  - Unguided medium: wireless
    - e.g., air, water, vacuum

## Terminology (2)
- Direct link
  - Refer to the transmission path between the transmitter and receiver in which signals propagate directly with no intermediate devices, other than __amplifiers__ or __repeaters__ used to increase signal strength
  - Apply to both guided and unguided media

- A transmission medium is __point-to-point__ if:
  - Direct link
  - Only 2 devices share the medium

- A transmission medium is __multipoint__ if:
  - More than 2 devices share the same medium

## Terminology (3)
- Simplex transmission
  - Signals are transmitted in only one direction
    - e.g. TV, radio

- Half duplex
  - Signals can be transmitted in either direction
  - Only one way at a time
    - e.g. police radio

- Full duplex
  - Both stations may transmit simultaneously
    - e.g. telephone

## Signals: Time Domain
- Electromagnetic signals are used as a means to transmit data
- A signal is generated by the transmitter and transmitted over a medium
- __The signal is a function of time, but it can also be expressed as a function of frequency__
- Time domain concepts: an electromagnetic signal can be either analog or digital
  - ___Analog signal___
    - The signal intensity varies in a smooth fashion over time. Or, there is no breaks or discontinuities in the signal 连续不断

  - ___Digital signal___
    - The signal intensity maintains a constant for some period of time and then changes to another constant level 一段一段的

## Comparison of analog and digital signals
- __Time domain function__ of a signal: _s(t)_
  - Specifies the amplitude (in volts) of the signal at each instant in time 在一定时间内有多少伏特
- __Frequency domain function__ of a signal: _S(f)_
  - Specifies the signal in terms of various frequency (in Hz) components 在一定时间内有多少频率

## Representing a Signal
- 3 components:
  1. ___Amplitude___
     - The height of the wave above or below a given reference point
     - Amplitude is usually measured in __volts__

  2. ___Frequency___
     - The number of times a signal makes a complete cycle within a given time frame
     - Frequency is usually measured in __Hertz (Hz)__, or __cycles per second (period = 1/frequency)__
     - __Spectrum__
        - Range of frequencies that a signal spans from minimum to maximum 最小到最大的频率范围
     - __Bandwidth__
        - Absolute value of the difference between the lowest and the highest frequencies of a signal 最小到最大的频率之间的绝对值差
     - The average voice has a frequency range of roughly 300Hz to 3100Hz
       - Spectrum = (300 ~ 3100) Hz
       - Bandwidth = (3100-300 = 2800) Hz
     - Frequency is the rate of change with the respect to time
       - Change in a short span of time means __high frequency__
       - Change in a long span of time means __low frequency__
       - if a signal doesn't change at all, its frequency is __zero__
       - If a signal changes instantaneously, its frequency is __infinite__
  3. ___Phase___
     - The position of the waveform relative to time 0
     - A change in phase can be any number of angles between 0 and 360 degree
     - Changes often occur on common angles, such as 45, 90, 135...

## Periodic Signals 
- ___periodic signals___
  - the same signal pattern repeats over time 一直重复

- ___aperiodic signals (Non periodic)___
  - e.g. Trade signals
